    <p>Curious and passionate software engineer, mostly self-taught.</p>
    <p>I'm passionate about mapping, people, music, like to write code but also tech article when I have some spare time.</p>
    <p>I try to spend quality time with quality people, not always easy when you are consumed by your passion.. and your girlfriend shares them.</p>
    <p>I like to travel, anywhere, anytime, but that freedom is not a cheap things.</p>
    <p>Working in an ambitious and fun environment, I'm not specially interested in work opportunity, but open to discussion.</p>
    <p>Hope to contribute to some open-source project one day.</p>
    <p>Finally I'm more and more interested in sharing my experience with other people, teaching my technical skills but also my life experience.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Take cares and have fun ;)</p>
